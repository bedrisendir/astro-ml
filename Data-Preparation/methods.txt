DATA PREP METHODS
-Check for NaN inputs. Copy from previous data point if available. Each data point ( 15 sec )

-Pre-define threshold for each column. (very small number)

-Compute de standard deviation of each column. Compare results with thresholds. Remove columns if they are below predefined thresholds.

-Feature Reduction PCA.
Find highly co-related columns. 
We should expect something like this after running PCA.
PCA also chooses the best combination from a set of possible linear functions that
retains maximu m variance of our data. In our case,the initial 163 features were reduced to around 50 features after PCA.
